# How much does place matter?

- Are area based effects a valid policy potion for government today?
- Roger Burrows, Johnathan Bradshaw argue there is little evidence that area based policies alleviate poverty.
- **Both argue for longitudinal studies**

- Neighbourhood effect of political voting patterns, red yellow blue uniformity on streets.



## Do we care about area effects?

- McCulloch: difficulty measuring area effects given the nature of the variables in the census.
- His argument assumes, that government employs abis to counter adverse nighbourhood effects and that there are only limited neighbourhood effects beyond the accululation of individual ones.
- **Note:** what does he considre to be an area effect? Is the BHPS sample distrubted geographically best designed for idenfitying area effects? -- british household panel survey
- Barnes and lucas 1975, deprivation not neatly clusterd on the map, so most deprived individuals and families do not live  in the most deprived areas, therefore area based policy alone doesnt work
- These 70s policies too individualistic and not structural enough in their approach to the causes of pverty and deprivation , townsend 1979. 

### Individdual level policies mainstream policies versus abis

- new wave of ABIs, comes from similar dispostiion, used to compliment individual level programmes. Area based policies useful addition to mainstream programmes
- resources going to area based programmes have increased, but bulk of funding goes towards households due to benefit syste (Bramley et al., 1998)

### Do ABIs inefficiently target deprived people

- usually argued that they are not approriate, more people outside such areas, thus poor targeting
- but poor poeple spatially concentrated
- long skew of deprived areas, extreme areas
- note, children in poverty, narrow definition, using wards in top quintile 58% of poor children but only 33% of all children.
- **Why do we have a spatial concentration of deprived people?** Not just individual problems, structural changes in the employment of housing markets, also housing allocation and dispersal policies, e.g. South Coast seaside resorts have some of the highest levels of deprivation as a result of transfers of unempolyed or other failies from london. This is considered a structural problem rather than an individual problem, should be handled by removing the problem at source. 
- Often stability in some deprived areas, still deprived 19th century to 21st. why?
- Slower rate of drop in unemployment in certain areas, considered an area effect? In part due to high numbers of pensioners or lone parents? obviously these areas improve much less than areas with fewer elderly.
- Some restricted movement from buying houses from local authority, and mining closure.

### ABIs for locally delivered policies

- some policy have to be area based, rather than individual
- some ambiguous, e.g. education, some schools less strict catchment, but others defined.
- See information about 'school effects' or 'contextual effects'
- peer group and other factors important for educational outcomes. this area effect?
- Sure Start Package, not clear how  could be individual level and not area. evidencd that individual targeted provision e.g. traditional local authority day nurseries for disadvantaged young children have been among the least effective forms of provision in promoting long term development Sylva 1994

### Area Effects

- Area effects suggests that there is more going on in an area than simply the concentration of poor people.
- Compounding disadvantage?
- Need better measurements than decennial census, longitudinal?

### Evidence based policy and practice
